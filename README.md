# Basic ESP8266 WeMos Matrix Shield for Digital Morphing Clock

**This project has been deprecated** please check new version with ESP32 and DMA version [here](https://github.com/hallard/WeMos-Matrix-Shield-DMA)

This shield is used to get simplify ESP8266 connectivity with a [WeMos][22] ESP8266 and nice matric RGB led. This idea came from excellent project called [Morphing Digital Clock][3] done by [HariFun][1] Instructable

See it in action, nice isn't it?

**Pay attention V1.2 got a missing trace between Input and Output connector G1**
See Issue [#2](https://github.com/hallard/WeMos-Matrix-Shield/issues/2). and how to fix. If you have V1.2 don't forget to solder a wire between these 2 points (see below). Thanks to nthonyjclarke and dragondaud for pointing this out

This breakout has just few minimal features.

**New in V1.6**

- added experimetal support for ESP32 boards with WeMos Mini D1 wiring called ESP32 Mini Kit or ESP32 Wemos, or ESP32 MH-ET Live such as this [banggood model](https://www.banggood.com/Wemos-D1-Mini-ESP32-ESP-32-WiFiBluetooth-Internet-Of-Things-Development-Board-Based-ESP8266-p-1205854.html) or this [aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/MH-ET-LIVE-D1-mini-ESP32-ESP-32-WiFi-Bluetooth-Internet-of-Things-development-board-based/32815530502.html). But you can find a lot also on ebay, not a problem.
- PCB board has been extented to fit this ESP32 Mini module but also backward compatible with WeMos Mini D1 ESP8266.

Please check wiring and picture before ordering, should looks like something like that:

**New in V1.5**

- changed power connector spacing to fit the same than Matrix one's [#4](https://github.com/hallard/WeMos-Matrix-Shield/issues/4)
- added space for smaller Matrix power connector [#4](https://github.com/hallard/WeMos-Matrix-Shield/issues/4)
- generated [gerbers files](https://github.com/hallard/WeMos-Matrix-Shield/master/gerbers/)

**New in V1.4**

- Added DS18B20 footprint + 4K7 PullUp resistor (DS18B20 DQ connected to GPIO0/D3)
- Removed E connection to add DS18B20 (DQ PIN), added solder jumper if needed this connection back.
- added space for barrel DC connector if connector input connector is top soldered see [#3](https://github.com/hallard/WeMos-Matrix-Shield/issues/3)
- Changed LDR orientation

**New in V1.3**

- Fixed missing trace missing beetwen Input and Output connector G1. That was cutted by accident when creating V1.2 from V1.1.

**New in V1.2**

- Added footprint for a Photoresistor (LDR) + Resistor to be able to adjust luminosity with ambiant light
- This version has a missing trace between Input G0 and Output G1, connect a wire has follow to fix

<img src="https://github.com/hallard/WeMos-Matrix-Shield/raw/master/pictures/fix-v12-wire.jpg">


**New in V1.1**

- Power, added big connector 3.5mm spaced to put the supplied power cable
- Changed 3.5mm Phoenix connector by a 5mm one allowing the stronger power cable to fit info
- Moved output connector to the right you can use the supplied flat band connector
- Output connector can go straight to output connector of Matrix, allowing to use a 6 PIN ISP Arduino Like ribbon cable.
- Increased PCB traces width for 5V power
- Added some wiring info on bottom silk


**Still in V1.0+**

- DC Barrel power connector 
- Zero Press Fit power connector
- All necessary headers to connect the Matric Shield

WeMos provide 3 D1, [D1 Mini Lite][20], [D1 Mini][21] or [D1 Mini Pro][22].

**V1.0 boards are tested and working**. But it was missing B1 on 6 pin out connector, so you should grab it elsewhere, but it's now fixed on V1.1+ and also aligned out connector pins to the needed Matrix Order. You can order boards V1.4 at [PCBs.io][4]

You can order the PCB of this board at [PCBs.io][4]. PCBs.io give me some reward when you order my designed boards from their site. This is pretty good, because I can use these rewards to create and design new boards and order them for free, so if you don't care about PCB manufacturer please use PCBs.io.

# Firmware

I suggest to use the excellent code done by [dragondaud](https://github.com/dragondaud/myClock), it has all I wanted to do and mandatory feature, OTA and LDR Luminosity management.

# Assembled boards

Board have been made to be plugged directly on the matrix shield, see picture below:

Theese are pictures of the 1st PCB V1.0 with LDR Live Fix, just to see how are connected wire, I'm waiting new boards (V1.3), to take new pictures and show easier connecting.


**2x8 pins female connector is soldered on the bottom side of PCB**

# BOM

Nothing fancy, just some headers and 2 differents power conector (choose the one you prefer) :

 - Ebay search for "DC Power Jack Barrel PCB Mount"
 <img src="https://github.com/hallard/WeMos-Matrix-Shield/raw/master/pictures/DC-Power-Barrel.jpg">
 - Phoenix contact PCB terminal block - SPTAF ref 1864286 (V1.0) or 1864435 (V1.1+) can be found anywhere
 <img src="https://github.com/hallard/WeMos-Matrix-Shield/raw/master/pictures/SPTAF-1864286.jpg">
- Ebay search for "2X8 Pin 2.54mm Double Row Female Header" or polulu product #1028, you can also use twice 1x8 pin female or even twice 2x4 pins female, plenty of option for this one
